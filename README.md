### Longest Compounded Word Search

This Java program is designed to search for the longest compounded word in a given text or list of words. A compounded word is a word that can be formed by concatenating two or more smaller words that exist in the text or list.

#### Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Build the Java application using the following command:

   ```shell
   javac LongestCompoundedWord.java
   ```

3. Run the application, providing a text or list of words as input:

   ```shell
   java LongestCompoundedWord "input.txt"
   ```

   You can also provide a list of words separated by spaces:

   ```shell
   java LongestCompoundedWord "word1 word2 word3"
   ```

4. The program will analyze the input and display the longest compounded word it finds in the text.

#### Example

Suppose you have an input file named "input.txt" with the following content:

```
apple banana orange applebanana dog cat
```

Running the program with this input:

```shell
java LongestCompoundedWord "input.txt"
```

The program will output:

```
Longest compounded word: applebanana (apple + banana)
```

Feel free to experiment with different inputs and texts to find the longest compounded words in your own data.

For more details on how the program works and the Java code behind it, please refer to the source code and documentation in this repository.

Happy searching!
